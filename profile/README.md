# Trace React

Hi there! I'm Travis, founder and CEO of Trace React.

Growing up, I always had a passion for technology. From jail-breaking my PlayStation Portable and iPod touch to opening up old laptops to see how they worked, I was simply intrigued.

These days, I find myself deeply enjoying website development. So much so, I created a business to help design, develop, <em>and</em> host websites for others! I love bringing ideas to life with eye-pleasing designs and slick animations.
